Association Rules on Burn Injury Data
----------------

This project involves using R to examine a dataset containing information about burn victims.  I analyzed the data to generate association rules, which offer insights about cases that frequently appear together.  The goal is to understand some of the causes for certain burn cases and identify factors that influence burn severity.

The full report can be found in the file "Association Mining.pdf".  This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, model creation, model results, and proposed solutions.  Tables, visualizations, and a copy of my code are included in the appendices.

The dataset "burn.csv" was provided by my course instructor at the University of Maryland University College.  I created a modified version ("burn_edit.csv") for this project by using the code sheet provided.  The original data source ("BURN1000.txt") was published by GitHub user lbraglia on their repository:

The R script is included in the file "association rules script.R".  The requirements are described in the file "requirements.txt".  Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file.  After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
